# zotion
quick connector between zotero and notion, written in python

based on pyzotero (https://github.com/urschrei/pyzotero) and the python notion client (https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py)

if you're seeing this, it is a work in progress. please feel free to message me on the notion devs slack with ideas! @Haley Keglovits
